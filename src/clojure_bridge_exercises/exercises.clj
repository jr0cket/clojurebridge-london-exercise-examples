;; Introduction to Programming with Clojure


;; Some really basic concepts

;; Everything is a list in Clojure.  List stands for List Processing.  So what is a list and does it work

;; Really simplistic example - a shopping list

(shopping-in-tesco "eggs" "bacon" "cheese" "cerial" "milk")

;; We have a list of things we want to buy.  the first item in the list defines how we are going to get these things
